### Want to add your project to the repository?

You can contribute by adding your Projects under the `public` --> `Projects`.  Create a directory by your name here. Add your individual projects to this folder.

```
root
â””â”€â”€  public
|      â””â”€â”€Projects
|          â”œâ”€â”€ Your Name
|          â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ Project Name
|          â”‚    â”‚     â””â”€â”€ Code files
|          |    â”‚     â””â”€â”€ deployedLink.txt
|          |    |     â””â”€â”€ thumbnail.png
|          |    |
|          â”‚    â”‚
|          â”‚    â””â”€â”€ Project Name
|          â”‚          â””â”€â”€ Code files
|          |          â””â”€â”€ deployedLink.txt
|          |          â””â”€â”€ thumbnail.png
```

Don't forget to add a `deployedLink.txt` file in each project folder, which should contain the link where your project is deployed. Also add a screenshot of your project as `thumbnail.png` file.

* *Use PascalCase or Snake-Case naming convention for project folders.*
